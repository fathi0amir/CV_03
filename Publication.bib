  abstract = {A far-field optical microscope (OM) is a powerful noninvasive, nondestructive tool to study sub-micrometer structures and organisms, which has been used for decades to study the interactions between light and matter in the spatial domain. We report here a sophisticated label-free OM method with superspatial resolution to visualize ZnO nanoparticles. Of three femtosecond pulses, two served as pumps at 1000 nm and the other one served as a probe at 774 nm. The two pumps (one of Gaussian shape and the other of toroidal shape) were generated with a phase difference of 180°. When the conventional pump-probe approach was used in the absence of a second toroidal pump, a ZnO nanoparticle was observed to show a particle size of 445 nm because of the limit of diffraction. In contrast, when the second toroidal pump was applied out of phase, the obtained OM image showed a ZnO nanoparticle down to 96 nm. We demonstrated for the first time that the reported phase-modulated pump-probe approach has an ability for spatial resolution beyond its optical diffraction limit and a potential for label-free imaging applications in nanomaterials and life sciences.},

  abstract = {A graphene oxide (GO) film is functionalized with metal (Au) and metal‐oxide (MoOx) nanoparticles (NPs) as a hole‐extraction layer for high‐performance inverted planar‐heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These NPs can increase the work function of GO, which is confirmed with X‐ray photoelectron spectra, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra measurements. The down‐shifts of work functions lead to a decreased level of potential energy and hence increased Voc of the PSC devices. Although the GO‐AuNP film shows rapid hole extraction and increased Voc, a Jsc improvement is not observed because of localization of the extracted holes inside the AuNP that leads to rapid charge recombination, which is confirmed with transient photoelectric measurements. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the GO‐AuNP device attains 14.6{\%}, which is comparable with that of the GO‐based device (14.4{\%}). In contrast, the rapid hole extraction from perovskite to the GO‐MoOx layer does not cause trapping of holes and delocalization of holes in the GO film accelerates rapid charge transfer to the indium tin oxide substrate; charge recombination in the perovskite/GO‐MoOx interface is hence significantly retarded. The GO‐MoOx device consequently shows significantly enhanced Voc and Jsc, for which its device performance attains PCE of 16.7{\%} with great reproducibility and enduring stability.},

  abstract        = {The excitonic relaxation dynamics of perovskite adsorbed on mesoporous thin films of Al2 O3 and NiO upon excitation at 450 nm were investigated with femtosecond optical gating of photoluminescence (PL) via up-conversion. The temporal profiles of emission observed in spectral region 670-810 nm were described satisfactorily with a composite consecutive kinetic model and three transient components representing one hot and two cold excitonic relaxations. All observed relaxation dynamics depend on the emission wavelength, showing a systematic time-amplitude correlation for all three components. When the NiO film was employed, we observed an extent of relaxation proceeding through the non-emissive surface state larger than through the direct electronic relaxation channel, which quenches the PL intensity more effectively than on the Al2 O3 film. We conclude that perovskite is an effective hole carrier in a p-type electrode for NiO-based perovskite solar cells showing great performance.},
